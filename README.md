✨ E-Commerce Website Design (HTML, CSS) ✨

<P>
I crafted a visually appealing and fully responsive e-commerce website that offers a seamless shopping experience. The homepage captivates visitors with an eye-catching banner and featured categories that highlight top products with stunning visuals, prices, and ratings ⭐
Key highlights of the project:
📱 Designed a mobile-friendly drop-down menu and ensured full responsiveness across all devices.
🗂️ Created a 4-column footer to neatly organize important site links.
🎯 Focused on intuitive user experience and a clean, modern design layout
